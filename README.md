## Autobahn

This implementation has been tested for spec-compliance by the [Autobahn test
suite](https://github.com/crossbario/autobahn-testsuite). You can verify for
yourself by running the script in *tests/run_autobahn_container.sh*, then
starting the `autobahn` example. Test case reports will be output into
*tests/reports/clients*, containing an *index.html* for a summary.
